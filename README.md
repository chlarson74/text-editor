## Description 


This project is a text editor that runs in the browser. It is designed to be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. It uses data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline  

Work completed:
- Used terminal to install the node_modules package for mongoose, express.
- Required Express to produce necessary functionality
- Added logic to interact with the database.


## Usage 

Use a web browser either on or off line to interact with the app.

## Learning Points 

- I furthered my understanding of NODEjs packages
- I furthered my understanding databases
- I furthered my understanding of Heroku
